#Boost 1.55.0 for iOS and Android

CMake build script to build the desired parts of Boost for iOS and Android.

It is expected that this will be built using an appropriate toolchain for iOS or using the Android NDK toolchain.

You should be able to download a different version of boost and use that instead if you like, but some of the older
releases require some minor patches. It looks like the older patches are already applied to 1.55.0 so it should
work out of the box hopefully.
